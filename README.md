# BetterDesktop

This application hopes to become for Windows 10 what TotalSpaces2 is for Mac. It has a long way to go.

- Show an overview of all desktops in a grid
- Switch to other desktops using arrow keys (left/right wrapping, and up and down later)
- Switch to other desktops using modifier + numbers for desktops 1-9
- Move active window to another desktop using modifier + arrows/numbers
- Assign certain apps to open windows in a specified desktop (and then move to that desktop, later with a whitelist for this behavior)


A bit of API usage will come from some code in this app:

It uses this library:
https://github.com/Grabacr07/VirtualDesktop


Prerequisites:

- Open Start menu, type "multitasking", press enter, scroll down in the Multitasking settings to the Virtual Desktops section, change both options to "All desktops"
