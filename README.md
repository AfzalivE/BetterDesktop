# BetterDesktop

This application hopes to become for Windows 10 what TotalSpaces2 is for Mac. It has a long way to go.

- Show an overview of all desktops in a grid
- Switch to other desktops using arrow keys (left/right wrapping, and up and down later)
- Switch to other desktops using modifier + numbers for desktops 1-9
- Move active window to another desktop using modifier + arrows/numbers


A bit of API usage will come from some code in this app:
